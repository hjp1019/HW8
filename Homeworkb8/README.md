Answer these questions:

-What problem does the Observer pattern help solve?
A) Observer pattern help solve the dependancy between subscriberInterace
and PublisherLmpl. It's a Boolean information pushing notification
to the observer (subscriberInterace)
each time the subject(PublisherLmpl) change.


-How would you describe the Observer 
A)
Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
so that one object changes state, all its dependents are
notified and updated automatically. Just like the subscriberInterface
and all the other ones.

-Where is polymorphism used in this pattern?
A)
Polymorphism is use in 4 classes:EvensSubscriberLmp, 
OddsSubscriberLmp, ThreeSubscriberLmpl For the SubscriberInterace class 
and lastly PublisherLmpl for the PublisherInterface.


-Did the UML diagrams make the coding more straightforward?
A) In this case yes, it helps understand the relationship between all the 
Classes. Therefore, we can easily code using the design.
